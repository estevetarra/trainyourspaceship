Our sample size is 10 * training time
which is maximum N min  so N * 60 * 10 = N * 600  for each bot.
The output are the four possible actions (None, Left, Right, Fire).
Directions:
  00: N
  01: E
  10: S
  11: W
Relative distance:
  x, y
The input defined as a the following:
Your status (2 nodes):
  Direction
Enemy status(4 nodes):
  Relative distance
  Direction
Nearest bullet(5 nodes)
  Presence
  Relative distance
  Direction
2n Nearest bullet(5 nodes)
  Presence
  Relative distance
  Direction

Total input nodes : 16 nodes

With one hidden layer the number of weights is
Input * C1 + C1 * Output

With two layers
Input * C1 + C1 * C2 + C2 * output

The sample size should be 30 times the number of weights.
so I * C1 + C1 * O = N * 600 / 30

(16 + 4) * C1 = N * 20
C1 = N
